Like, this whole season -- I went through a whole season and I've never been, like, chopped down and been broken down. I've been chopped and a guy's gotten into my legs, but I've gotten out of it because I've been able to play through my hands and saw him coming at the last minute out of my peripheral vision. And so . . . And that's . . . A lot of times that's how guys get you. If a guy is running straight at you and chops you, like a running back, you're going to get around. Most athletes at this level -- or at pretty much any level, college level or an advanced high school level -- if a guy's running straight at you there's no way he's going to be able to cut you. They usually come in some trick or form that they're coming from a misdirection. They're going to be able to cut you that way. So being able to pick up on . . . For instance, like, if, uh, if, uh, I have a pulling guard in front of me and I'm in a [through] technique: If I see his eyes go away from me and he's crossing my face, I have to know that, one, he's crossing my face; somebody has to be coming back at me, whether that's a center or that's a fullback or a tight end coming back in motion to get me. And usually those guys don't want to go heads up with me, so they -- they're going low. So you've got to be able to use your hands and-and move your feet out of the way, basically bracing yourself through that person's body by them going down because once they've gone down they're -- they only have one motion that they're going to go into. So that's . . . The biggest thing is being able to play with your eyes and hands, especially your hands. That's the biggest thing that allows you to play off of them and get to the ball. Um, the best drill is to actually go through it. Uh, I wouldn't say 100 percent full speed because obviously you can get hurt. But you can simulate it fast enough to where you're in control and you can play off guys and have people coming at your feet. Another way is, um -- that we do it in-in the pros is we have heavy, uh, medicine . . . They're not . . . They're light medicine balls but they're pretty heavy and stout. And we get them thrown at us as hard as they can. They roll them as hard as they can at us, and we have to stop them and not have imbalance. You've got to stop them with the palms of your hands in place, and then -- and-and then get off and break out of that cut because it's full speed, it's a stop, and then you've got to get to the ball.

Then it can help your vision out, you know, on your cuts.", "id": 104}, {"interviewDate": "", "questionId": 139, "personId": 27, "topics": [], "answerEdited": "", "answer": "I think it starts with, uh, knowing you have the ability to do it, first of all, you know, 'cause you wouldn't be back there if you didn't. Um, the first thing is ball security. To catch, um, a lot of people, they-they get -- their vision get distorted because they're worried about the gunners. Um, trust in your blockers. Um, when you, uh, you . . . When the ball is snapped what I do is I look to see where their gunners are releasing. As soon as the ball is snapped I look and see where the gunners are  releasing. They both tend to release in one direction with the other. That tells me where the ball is going to be kicked so then I can start to work myself to that direction. So when the ball is hot I get on it. The gunners, they release in one direction. Then I start cheating. Then I get my b-- eyes back on their punter, and he's usually going to the same direction they're going to. And then I'm already in a -- I'm one step ahead. So then when the-the ball is kicked I'm looking at the ball. And then I see where the ball is going to land. I've got a good trajectory of where it's going to land.  Then I put my eyes down at a-a slight glance at their gunners to see where they're at. If they're on me I'm thinking if they catch -- if they're like, you know, free range my guys didn't do good, you know, if they're catching all the way. But if they're, you know, far away that you see they're getting handled, you see they're getting blocked you can even tell they're getting blocked from over the line when they release if they've got collision. Usually when they get collision off the break they're getting blocked. That's going to hold them up just enough for you to catch it and make a move.  So if-if they're not blocked, you know, [you-you're in] their free range, you see them running full-out sprint and they're so close and they're getting closer you-you're probably [unintelligible] catch. But if you see them -- as soon as you take your initial look and you see them get held up, then you take another look and they're not really far down field and they're not really at a full sprint 'cause they're getting blocked or [got his] hand on them, you know you're going to take it.  So you settle underneath the ball, make a good catch. The only thing that matters is the catch. After that you let your athletic ability take [head] and you let your l-- athletic ability take stride. You want to get north and south first -- the opposite thing that you -- that a gunner wants the returner to do. And th-they hate when returners get north and south first. Then you can make your-your moves sideways to break the big ones. So the most important thing is getting up the field past the first line of defense, which are the gunners. Once you get up the field into them, then you can make your move right or left. And it's usually going to be off a slower, bigger guy who's not agile enough to keep up with you going right or left. The faster, more agility guys are the first line -- the first [end] guys, the fastest guys, which are the gunners.  The gunners are usually the better athletes. If you get past them it's usually the bigger, slower guys in-in the middle that's going to force you to go right or left. And that's all, that's-that's all what it's about: getting vertical, then making a move either to the right or left to the, to the side that the, that the punt is called, the play, whether it's a right punt or a left one or a middle. So you get vertical first, then right or left. That's your vision. Vertical, then right or left off the-the closest defender on you, off his leverage.

That's one of the things that we've noticed with a lot of our kids that allows them to get to the next level, at the college level, and be able to contribute right away. A lot of these kids, once they get their nutrition down, they understand that they have to work and strength train and do all that thing and then commit to a year-round program, then what we're noticing is that once they get all those little pieces, then comes the fundamentals of football. So for us, we record everything, their practices, their games -- everything is recorded. So we can look at several things: How do they focus their time accordingly throughout the year, throughout the school day, to be able to watch film and understand their position better and understand what the opponent's doing?

And the reason you need to be strong is 'cause you've got levers on your body that you've got to move. You've got to accelerate your mass and you've got to decelerate it. And if you don't have the-the strength to support that mass, um, you're not going to be able to overcome inertia very well to-to-to start or stop. And so as a trainer, you know, absolute strength is-is one component that we may look at just to see how strong someone is; um, but it's the relative strength -- to me -- that's the most important component when it comes to, you know, weight-training. It's \"How strong are you in relation to your own mass?\" because that's going to tell me, you know, whether or not you're going to have any chance of-of moving fast. For example, if you're someone that's really big and heavy but you're weak, you're going to have a tough time, you know, initiating a movement. But if you're someone who's really strong for your size, you're going to be able to apply a lot of force into the ground and you're going to be able to get your body moving. So in the weight room anything you can do to enhance, like, your leg strength, uh, your hip strength, your hamstring strength -- you know, y-you want balanced strength. Um, and, um, you know, a lot of people, I think, will, you know, spend time doing heavy squats and-and stuff like that to, um, you know . . .But sometimes, I think, that's a risk for a lot of athletes because they don't have the core strength and stability to support the kind of weights they're trying to lift. And they usually don't maintain, uh, the proper form when they're doing it, either, 'cause they're trying to get a max or something and I-I think it can be really dangerous. I'm more interested in -- to see, like, how they can do, like, a single-leg squat, you know, holding dumbbells with their back foot up on a box, or-or step-ups or walking lunges or, um, speed squats, even. And-And what I mean by \"speed squats\" is they're using a ladder weight and they're exploding up through the movement instead of going slowly. So it's not that you don't want to ever lift heavy and-and build that strength, but, um, in the weight room if you want to do things to impres-- im-improve your speed you've got to make sure you're doing some things, uh, explosively, unilaterally -- like one leg versus the other -- and, um, try to work around the hips, you know, some things for extension of-of, you know, the knee and the hip. But don't forget, uh, the eccentric strengthening for your hamstrings. And when we talk about \"eccentric,\" that means that the hamstrings are being lengthened as they're actually being contracted. And some of the exercises we do for that are, like, single-leg RDLs, reverse leg-curls, um, and-and stuff like that that-that's critical to balance out the quad-to-hamstring ratio and help you, uh, train the muscles that are important for running fast.", "id": 107}, {"interviewDate": "Audio Interview (Jimmy), 29 March 2011, Nike Pro Camp @ WHQ", "questionId": 22, "personId": 29, "topics": [], "answerEdited": "", "answer": "Footwork?

But if you're just putting on dead weight, like fat mass, um, chances are it's going to slow you down a little bit. So you've got to be careful as an athlete how fast you put that weight on.

And, um, that's going to help them drive into it, and then it's going to -- it's going to have them accelerate out of it. Then I'll flip it around and I'll actually assist them into the route. So they've got to decelerate and then change r-- direction for the come-back against resistance. And that's going to do two things. When you assist someone into the movement they've got to do this eccentric d-d-deceleration where they have to put on the brakes.

So the bungee cords, to me, is something that can really enhance an athlete's ability to-to-to break out of a route. You've just to be careful, though, because when you assist someone into a movement and they've got to break down and stop and then change direction you're always risking, you know, hurting the knees and-and-and-and, you know, tweaking an ankle or something.
